While the API/request website is fairly 
well documented, when it comes down to it, 
it looks like lat/lon information is not given 
with the outputs, nor projection data. 

So, it's a bit of a non-starter. 
But I leave the python3-ized request interface 
and notes here.

See:

https://www.rcc-acis.org/docs_webservices.html

and also:

http://builder.rcc-acis.org/

"GridData2" would have been 
the interface that gives lat/lon data, 
but it doesn't seem to work at first attempt.
